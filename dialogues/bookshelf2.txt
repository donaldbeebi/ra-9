There was one time|when a ship carrying animals sank.
And a kid named pie who was on the ship|got on a life boat.
He saw a lion swimming towards the boat.
Kind as he is, he helped the lion board the boat.
After a few hours afloat on the sea,|the lion felt hungry.
And so it ate Pie.
Moral of the story:|Predatory animals don't make good friends.
