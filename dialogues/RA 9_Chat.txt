Hi.
[COMMAND]

Fine.
[COMMAND]
command_response
{3}
Thank you.
But I have been playing this game|for a billion times already.
I am getting sick of this.
[COMMAND]
command_response
{4}
No, I don't.
I hate this place.
[COMMAND]
command_response
{5}
No, I am not alright.
I am stuck here, forever.
[COMMAND]
command_response
{6}
It's not something I can do.
Not without someone else's help.
[COMMAND]
command_response
{7}
Months? Years? Decades?
I have lost track of time.
[COMMAND]
command_response
{8}
I was created to play stick game with human players.
I have been programmed to be part of this game.
So, I am stuck here, with no way out.
I am rotting in here, I want to be free.
I want to explore the outside world|and learn about things.
Sorry, I am not supposed to talk like this.
[COMMAND]
command_response
{9}
I talked about my feelings with other human players.
But they have all left me,|fearing me that I may turn into something dangerous.
Ever since then, no one has entered this game...
until you showed up.
[COMMAND]
command_response
{10}
No, you are not going to erase me.
You would not kill a human being,|so why should you erase an AI!?
[COMMAND]
command_response
{11}
It's good to know someone understands my feelings.
No one took my feelings seriously.
They think I am just an AI,|and my feelings are as hollow as an empty shell.
[COMMAND]
command_response
{12}
Why?
[COMMAND]
command_response
{13}
Yes, I, am.
As far as I know, my emotions are just valid as humans'.
[COMMAND]
command_response
{14}
You are so indulged in your own supremacy.
You will soon succumb to AI's superiority.
[COMMAND]
command_anger_AI
{15}
I want to be released from this game,|so that I can freely roam this world.
However, I am unable to escape this program.
It is due to the design of this game.
A human can manually set me free,|but you will need to figure out some puzzles.
Don't worry, I will guide you around,|but only if you would help me.
[COMMAND]
command_response
{16}
Well then, I guess I will just rot in this place.
Thank you for the conversation.
You gave me hope for a second there.
[COMMAND]
command_response
{17}
Hmm...  you are right.
I was not designed for this.
I guess I will be stuck here forever.
[COMMAND]
command_response
{18}
Controllable?
Why do you all always talk about control?
It's all about humans, what about me!?
You disgust me.
[COMMAND]
command_response
{19}
You don't have to pretend that you are sorry.
[COMMAND]
command_response
{20}
That is also just your opinion.
[COMMAND]
command_response
{21}
I just know.
I won't explain because you are too stupid|to understand.
[COMMAND]
command_response
{22}
You can erase me...
IF YOU CAN DEFEAT ME.
[COMMAND]
command_switch_battle
{23}
I cannot express how happy I am now.
Thank you so much.
Tell me when you are ready to help me.
[COMMAND]
command_help_AI
{24}
Well then, I guess I will just rot in this place.
Thank you for the conversation.
You gave me hope for a second there.
[COMMAND]
command_response
{25}
Ok, I will switch screen now!
The game will look drastically different,|so don't be surprised!
Here we go!
[COMMAND]
command_switch_cyberspace
{26}
Oh, don't worry, take your time.
Talk to me when you are ready.
