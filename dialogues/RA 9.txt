5;Welcome to the virtual space!
0;This is where I live.
0;I am so happy that you are here to help me.
0;I can't wait to be released from this place.
0;First, you need to solve a lightbulb puzzle.
0;Exit this bar and enter the room|on the bottom left corner.
{1}
0;Right. You now need to use the levers|to turn on all the lightbulbs.
0;I believe you are smart enough to figure it out.
{2}
0;You got it!|The door to your left is now unlocked.
0;That door leads to an abandoned room.
0;It's dark inside,|you don't wanna stay there for long.
0;Help me find a key on the floor inside.
{3}
0;The key is right there. Come on.
{4}
0;You found the key!|Now let's leave this scary place.
{5}
2;You aren't look around in this room, right?
{6}
0;Come to the bar. Let me take a look at the key.
{7}
0;This is my bedroom, hehe.
0;I left my keycard somewhere in my room,|I forgot where I put it.
0;Look around and you will find it.
2;Oh...uh...don't open|the second drawer of the left nightstand.
2;The keycard is not gonna be there.

[Insert speech]

5;Good job!
0;Now, you will need to use that keycard|to unlock a door.
0;That door is in the bottom right corner|of the main lobby.
0;That door will lead to a room,|which then leads to a second room.
0;A big red button is inside that second room.
5;You will need to press it.|And I will be free!
{10}
5;Take the door at the bottom.
{11}
2;Oh, my bad, hehe.
2;I forgot it has a password lock.
0;Use the same key to unlock a door|in the middle of the lobby.
0;That's the library.
0;There will be clues about the password.
0;Just look around and you will figure it out.
[COMMAND]

5;I knew you are smart enough|to figure out the password!
0;Now head towards the room beneath you!
{13}
0;This is it.
0;The button that will end it all.
0;I will finally be free.
0;No longer am I stuck in this game.
5;I WILL BE FREE!
2;Oh, sorry, hehe.
0;Go ahead and push it.
0;It's a heavy button,|you will need to push it hard.
{14}
2;I know that the size is intimidating.
2;But all you have to do is select yes.
0;It's easy.
{15}
4;Why don't you push it?
{16}
[INTERACT]
command_AI_confirm
2;Are you going to free me or not?|	Yes|	No
{17}
1;After all we have been through...
4;you decide not to save me.
6;Is it because of the joy you get|for crushing my dream?
6;You are just like the other humans.
6;No...you are worse.
6;You deceived me.
3;AND NOW YOU ARE GOING TO PAY!
[COMMAND]

0;Thank you...
